# ZXDB

ZXDB is an open database containing historical information of software, hardware, magazines and books about ZX-Spectrum and related machines.

It was created by **Einar Saukas**, starting from the full content of **Martijn van der Heide**'s [Original WorldOfSpectrum](https://web.archive.org/web/20151117205811/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/), **Jim Grimwood**'s [SPOT/SPEX/TTFn](http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/), **Daren Pearcy**'s [RZX Archive](http://www.rzxarchive.co.uk/), and **Chris Bourne**'s [ZXSR](http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/) repositories (all of them imported with consent, directly from their internal files). Afterwards it was expanded with literally tens of thousands of corrections, additions, and integration from many other sources. It's currently the most widely used Sinclair related database, feeding several Spectrum websites, an [open API](https://api.zxinfo.dk/v3/) at [ZXInfo](https://zxinfo.dk/), and the mobile application [Zx App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bricboys.zxapp) that uses this API. It's also used as index reference by a dozen different websites and services.

For further details, visit the [ZXDB forum section](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/forums/viewforum.php?f=32) at [Spectrum Computing](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/).


## Getting Started

Simply download the latest database content, then load it into MySQL/MariaDB:

* `ZXDB_mysql.sql.zip` - The latest complete ZXDB database script for MySQL/MariaDB. That's all you really need!

Optionally you can execute one of the provided scripts to convert file `ZXDB_mysql.sql` above to a different RDBMS:

* `scripts/ZXDB_to_SQLServer.ps1` - Powershell script to convert ZXDB into SQL Server compatible T-SQL

* `scripts/ZXDB_to_SQLite.py` - Python script to convert ZXDB into SQLite compatible SQL

* `scripts/ZXDB_to_generic.groovy` - Groovy script to convert ZXDB into a (more) generic SQL

There's also an optional script to create auxiliary tables, that can be used to help database searches. Ideally these tables must be repopulated whenever ZXDB content changes, or defined as materialized views in a RDBMS that supports it:

* `scripts/ZXDB_help_search.sql` - Script to create auxiliary tables prefixed with `search_by_`

The ZXDB distribution already includes links and references to integrated sites like [Speccy Screenshot Maps](http://maps.speccy.cz/) and [ZX-Spectrum Reviews (ZXSR)](http://zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/), but this information can also be updated independently. There are separate scripts to reimport them into ZXDB:

* `scripts/*-ZXDB_import_*.sql` - Scripts to reimport information from integrated sites (additional details are explained in each file)

Finally there's a script for health checking, that validates ZXDB consistency rules that cannot be enforced by check constraints:

* `scripts/ZXDB_health_check.sql` - Script to identify data inconsistencies in ZXDB

#### _ADDITIONAL DETAILS_

Tables prefixed with `spex_` contain information from SPOT/SPEX/TTFn archive that differs from the Original WorldOfSpectrum archive, thus pending further investigation later.

Local file links starting with `/pub/` refer to content previously available at the Original WorldOfSpectrum archive. These files are currently accessible from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) mirror at https://archive.org/download/World_of_Spectrum_June_2017_Mirror/World%20of%20Spectrum%20June%202017%20Mirror.zip/World%20of%20Spectrum%20June%202017%20Mirror/

Local file links starting with `/nvg/` refer to content previously available at the ftp.nvg.unit.no archive. These files are currently accessible from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) mirror at https://archive.org/download/mirror-ftp-nvg/Mirror_ftp_nvg.zip/

Local file links starting with `/zxdb/` refer to content added afterwards. These files are currently stored at https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/zxdb/


## Concepts

#### _ABOUT RELEASES_

Each release in ZXDB corresponds to a standalone publication of a certain product (program, book, etc) as follows:

* Release #0 means the original release;
* Release #1 means the 1st re-release;
* Release #2 means the 2nd re-release;
* etc.

Normally it doesn't count as release when a product re-appears in non-standalone publications, such as included in a compilation, covertape, electronic magazine, bonus B-side of another program, or printed as type-in within a book or magazine. For instance [Target Renegade](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/4087) was originally published by **Imagine** (release #0), later re-published by **Erbe** (release #1) and **Hit Squad** (release #2). It was also included in a few compilations and covertapes, but none of them count as standalone releases. Another example is [Showdown](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/4483) that was originally published by **Artic Computing** (release #0) and later re-appeared in **Your Spectrum** as type-in, but the **Your Spectrum** publication is not considered a release.

However there's an exception to this rule. If a certain program was _not originally published as standalone_, then release #0 should reflect this information. Technically it means assigning a blank release #0 to this title (without publisher, release date or price), and flagging the original appearance of this program elsewhere as "original". For instance a program that was originally published within a [compilation](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/9340), [covertape](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/2420), [electronic magazine](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/399), [bonus B-side of another program](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/5675), or originally printed as type-in within a [book](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/17668) or [magazine](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/13286).
